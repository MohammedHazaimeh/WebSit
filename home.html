        <h3> The introduction</h3>
        <p>
          
          <br />
          The agricultural sector is an important and strategic sector 
          that provides added value to a number of sectors such as transport,
           labor, energy, industry and trade. The growth in the sector is 
           a distinct case, especially if it is identified alongside the partner
            sectors and with a contribution of up to 20% to the national income 
            and a growth rate of up to 4%, Where we look forward to developing the
             role of agricultural extension to be the advanced arm in simulating farmers 
             and giving them benefit and service by all direct and indirect means. 
             And scientific knowledge of the place and nature of agriculture, 
             in addition to the direct field role in communicating with farmers 
             in their places.
